# Introduction
I’m Sparrow, a driven security researcher who plunged into blockchain security in mid-2024 with one core belief: true growth happens at the intersection of curiosity and collaboration. While I’ve uncovered 35+ high/medium-severity vulnerabilities to date (and counting), my greatest strength lies in proactively seeking challenges that stretch my limits. I thrive when working alongside researchers better than myself, transforming complex problems into masterclasses in growth. Every audit is a chance to absorb new techniques, sharpen my approach, and contribute to collective security excellence.

"Securing code requires humility—knowing there’s always more to learn, and someone who can teach it."
