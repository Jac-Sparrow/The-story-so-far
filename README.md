# Introduction
**Hi, Iâ€™m Sparrow** ðŸ‘‹

**My story starts in sales...**

I spent years in salesâ€”talking to clients, solving their headaches, and learning how real people interact with systems. It taught me to listen deeply, communicate risks plainly, and fight for trust.

Then in 2024, I discovered Web 3 security.
By 2025, I took the leap: left sales and dove headfirst into auditing smart contracts.

Since then, Iâ€™ve uncovered 35+ high/medium-severity vulnerabilitiesâ€”but my greatest strength isnâ€™t just finding bugs:

Itâ€™s how I approach them.
- Like a salesperson turned bodyguard: I see beyond code to how exploits shatter trust
- With a hustlerâ€™s hunger: I chase challenges that scare me

Now?
Iâ€™m all-in on securityâ€”grinding daily to level up.
And Iâ€™m fascinated by how my sales-honed instincts will fortify this new path.

"Securing code requires humilityâ€”knowing thereâ€™s always more to learn, and someone who can teach it."
